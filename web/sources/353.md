Using ‘Hire humans. Not skills. Not roles.’ as our marching orders, the Lab’s profiles are Q&As with highly-impressive makers and strategists from media (and its fringes), each with unique perspectives on journalism, publishing and communications technology. We’re after smart people shaping the ways we communicate with technology, and not all of them work in a newsroom.
